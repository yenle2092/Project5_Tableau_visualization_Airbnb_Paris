## Project goal
The goals of this project is to develop the dashboard in Tableau that represents main insights (KPIs). THe dashboard should reflect the domain and be useful for the decisionb-making.

## Description of the dataset
#### Data collection:
The dataset is listing information of Airbnb in Paris via Airbnb Scraper and extracted data with prices listed on the 19th of April 2022. 
#### Data preparation: 
In jupiter notebook, we verified and cleaned the duplicates. We deleted some outliers (in the column number of guests was 0, or 89). With sql, we join two other tables that contained districts information and the accomodation type. 

## The insights we want to show
- Where are the highest number of airbnb locations in Paris ? (with a maps, and repartition by arrondissement) 2
- Which districts are the most expensive ? (with a map, and repartition by arrondissement) 2
- Calculate the price per person 1

- Is there a correlation between numbers of locations and the price ? (scatterplot) 1
- Repartition of number of location by number of guest (bar chart) 1
- Which type of location is the most looked after ?
